# Acrobot-ReinforcementLearning

## overview
The acrobot system includes two joints and two links, where the joint between the two links is actuated. Initially, the links are hanging downwards, and the goal is to swing the end of the lower link up to a given height.

## implementation
Implemented using the dueling deep Q learning algorithm to solve the acrobot environment
